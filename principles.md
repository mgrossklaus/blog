<div class="Principles">
  <h2>Websites are for users, code is for developers.</h2>
  <p>When building a website, our primary goal should be to serve the user. We need to write maintainable code that makes it as easy as possible for us and the next developer, but at the same this should never worsen the experience for the user. If code makes it easier for the developer, but worsens the experience for the user, it is bad code.</p>

  <h2>HTML first, afterwards CSS â€“ and only then JS.</h2>
  <p>HTML allows us to build an accessible and performant web <a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/846398983664734210" rel="noopener">by default</a>. This can be compromised when using CSS and JS, so we need to use it carefully. Frameworks should always only be used when they not only serve the developer, but also the user while not noticeably worsening the performance.</p>

  <h2>Design should not harm accessibility.</h2>
  <p>While design and animation should give a website uniqueness, people will not use a website when it is inaccessible or slow. For that very reason, we need to consider implications on performance and accessibility already when designing a website.</p>

  <h2>Learning basics before everything else.</h2>
  <p>HTML, CSS and JS, but also accessibility, performance and user experience need to be learned before diving into frameworks.
  A developer needs to understand at least the basics, to be able to evaluate what technology is necessary to build something. Using a framework without knowing enough basics can lead to a good developer experience, but a bad user experience.</p>
